## Description of the data including a plot

	 The chosen dataset contains the amount of new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed daily across all infected countries. This project will specifically focus on COVID-19 cases reported per day in the United States since March 12, 2020. It was obtained from the European Union CDC equivalent ( European Union Center for Disease Control and Prevention ) and is updated daily with the amount of new cases. This growing data set is mitigated by only keeping track of a two month (60 days) span during the peak of the outbreak in the United States. 
	 
	 For this submission, we are eliminating approximately 10% of data. For reference, the start date is March 12, 2020 and the end date is April 19,2020.

```{r Plotting data, echo=FALSE}
US <- filter(subsetfile, geoId == "US")

US_data  <- data.frame(Cases = US$cases)

US_data  <- US_data[order(US_data$Cases),]


US_series <- ts(US_data)

plot(US_series, main="Number of COVID-19 Cases in the US", xlab="Time (Days)", ylab="Number of Cases")
```

```{r part b,message = F, echo = F, warning = F,results='hide',fig.show='hide'}

acf2(US_series)
# We must first observe a second wave before we can consider seasonality calling the acf function we can observe that the model is an AR(1) model 
```

## Transformations and/or Differencing to achieve stationarity

	From the plot of the original untransformed data, there is an obvious increasing trend in the number of cases over time. In order to make this data stationary, the data went through differencing of order 2. The second order differencing plot below addresses and fixed the problem in the original data.

```{r transformation/differencing, message = F, echo = F, warning = F,results='hide',fig.show='hide'}
#Differencing of order 1
US_series.dff1 = diff(US_series)
plot(US_series.dff1,main="Number of COVID-19 Cases in the US \n(Differencing of Order 1)", xlab="Time (Days)", ylab="Number of Cases")
```

```{r differencing 2, echo=F}
#Differencing of order 2
US_series.dff2 = diff(US_series.dff1)
plot(US_series.dff2,main="Number of COVID-19 Cases in the US \n(Differencing of Order 2)", xlab="Time (Days)", ylab="Number of Cases")
```

```{r output for tests, message = F, echo = F, warning = F,results='hide',fig.show='hide'}
###-------------------------------------------------
# checking for autocorrelation
Box.test(US_series.dff1, type = "Ljung-Box")
# checking stationarity of second ln difference 
adf.test(US_series.dff1, alternative = "stationary")

# checking for autocorrelation
Box.test(US_series.dff2, type = "Ljung-Box")
# checking stationarity of second ln difference 
adf.test(US_series.dff2, alternative = "stationary")
```
	
## Estimated SARIMA model

The estimated SARIMA model for the data is ARMA(0,2,1). 

```{r model selection2,  message = F, echo = F, warning = F,results='hide',fig.show='hide'}
#Utilizing auto_arima

auto.arima(US_series.dff2, ic = 'aic', stationary = T, seasonal = F)
auto.arima(US_series.dff2, ic = 'bic', stationary = T, seasonal = F)
auto.arima(US_series.dff2, ic = 'aicc', stationary = T, seasonal = F)

# fitting several models

AR1_diff_2 = sarima(US_series.dff2, p=1, d=0, q=0)
AR1_diff_2

MA1_diff_2 = sarima(US_series.dff2, p=0, d=0, q=1)
MA1_diff_2
```

## Model Selection:

  From the ACF and PACF plots of the differenced data, there were several model options to explore ( MA(1) and AR(1) ). The best model for the data is the MA(1) model with second order differencing because it had the lowest variance, lowest AIC, and lowest BIC. 

## Residual Analysis:

```{r model selection3, message = F, echo = F, warning = F,results='hide'}
MA1_diff_2 = sarima(US_series.dff2, p=0, d=0, q=1)
```

	With the MA(1) model, all of the residual assumptions are satisfied. For example, the assumptions of normality, correlation, independence of the residuals have been satisfied. Also, the standardized residuals are mostly distributed around the mean. 

## Forecast/Predict the withheld data

```{r forecast, echo=F}
Forecast = sarima.for(US_series, n.ahead=4, p=0, d=2, q=1, P=0, D=0, Q=0, S=0)
```

## What percentage of the prediction intervals (2 s.e.) contained the actual values.

Actual data of those days:

April 23 37289
April 22 35527
April 21 34272
April 20 33901



```{r forecast2}

high = Forecast$pred + 2*Forecast$se
low = Forecast$pred - 2*Forecast$se

cbind(low,high)

```


100% of the actual data entries were within the confidence intervals for each day. 

## Calculate the Mean Absolute Prediction Error.
```{r forecast3}

# Complete the tables below. 𝑒ℎ=𝑥ℎ−𝑥̂ℎ where 𝑥̂ℎ is the h –step ahead t

table = data.frame(actual = c(33901, 34272, 35527, 37289), expected = Forecast$pred)

table$error = table$actual - table$expected

table

Mean_Absolute_Prediction_Error = (-1*sum(table$error))/4
Mean_Absolute_Prediction_Error

```

The Mean Absolute Prediction Error is approximately 2075.289, on average we average an error of approximate 2075 cases a day.


## Calculate the Root Mean Squared Prediction Error.
```{r forecast4}

table$error = (table$error)^2

RSME = sum(table$error)/4

RSME
```

The RSME is 2.643677e+13, which is relatively large.
